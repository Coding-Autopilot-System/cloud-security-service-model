# Governance and RAIC

## Governance model
The Cloud Security Service is governed through service reviews, risk oversight, and policy change controls. Decisions are
documented and measurable, with clear ownership for approval and escalation.

## RAIC model
RAIC is used for fast decision making:
- **Recommend:** Cloud Security Service proposes changes.
- **Approve:** Service Manager or delegated risk owner approves.
- **Implement:** Engineering teams execute changes.
- **Consult:** Risk, compliance, and platform stakeholders consulted.

## Decision domains
- Policy baselines
- Exception approvals
- Incident response outcomes
- Roadmap priorities
