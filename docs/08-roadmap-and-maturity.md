# Roadmap and Maturity

## Maturity phases

### Foundation
**Outcomes:** baseline policy coverage, centralized logging, defined incident process.
**Key initiatives:** landing zone standards, policy-as-code v1, SIEM onboarding.
**Exit criteria:** ≥ 90% of subscriptions covered by baseline policies; IR playbooks tested.
**Risks:** fragmented ownership, low compliance adoption.

### Standardization
**Outcomes:** consistent implementation across business units, improved evidence readiness.
**Key initiatives:** standardized templates, reporting cadence, exception workflows.
**Exit criteria:** KPI dashboard published monthly; exception backlog < 10 active items.
**Risks:** inconsistent change control, unmanaged exceptions.

### Automation
**Outcomes:** automated enforcement and remediation.
**Key initiatives:** policy-as-code CI/CD, auto-remediation runbooks, drift monitoring.
**Exit criteria:** ≥ 70% of findings auto-remediated; TTD/TTC targets met.
**Risks:** tooling gaps, inadequate testing pipelines.

### Optimization
**Outcomes:** continuous improvement and proactive risk reduction.
**Key initiatives:** predictive analytics, advanced detection tuning, cost optimization.
**Exit criteria:** KPI targets consistently met for 2+ quarters.
**Risks:** complacency, reduced focus on hygiene.
