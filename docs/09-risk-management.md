# Risk Management

## Risk register process
1. Identify risks during service reviews, assessments, or incidents.
2. Score risks using likelihood and impact.
3. Assign an owner and treatment plan.
4. Track and review on a quarterly cadence.

## Scoring method
- **Likelihood:** 1 (rare) to 5 (frequent)
- **Impact:** 1 (low) to 5 (severe)
- **Score:** Likelihood × Impact

## Treatment options
- Mitigate (reduce likelihood/impact)
- Transfer (e.g., insurance)
- Accept (risk acceptance with sign-off)
- Avoid (change approach)

## Review cadence
- Monthly service review: top 5 risks
- Quarterly risk review: full register
- Annual audit readiness: evidence validation
