# Vulnerability Management

## Objectives
- Detect, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities on a defined cadence.
- Measure remediation effectiveness and repeatability.

## Process
1. Discover vulnerabilities via scanning and advisories.
2. Prioritize based on severity, exposure, and asset criticality.
3. Remediate or accept risk with documented exceptions.
4. Verify fixes and update evidence.

## SLAs
| Severity | Target remediation |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | 7 days |
| High | 14 days |
| Medium | 30 days |
| Low | 90 days |
